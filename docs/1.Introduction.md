# Introduction

## Attribute-Based Access Control

Abac stands for attribute-based access control. It represents a logical access control from simple access control lists to more capable role-based access, and also the very flexible methods for access control through different attributes.

## Example of use

For example, if you have a bulletin board, and wants to let users access different areas based on several attributes. That could for example be:

* Min. age
* User level (from - to)
* Specific sex
* Less than 3 warnings
* _and much more..._

Abac is great for purposes like this. The possibility to make assertions based on groups of permissions/attributes makes it very easy to customize and create permission groups suiting your needs.
