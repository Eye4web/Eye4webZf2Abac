# Introduction

## Attrbiute-Based Access Control

Abac stands for attribute-based access control. It represents a logical access control from simple access control lists to more capable role-based access, and also the very flexible methods for access control through different attributes.

## Example of usage

Abac would for example allow you to have different ares with different access criterias based on the specific user/case's situation.

For example, if you have a bulletin board, and has Board A and Board B. Then you could set a number of criterias for the two boards.

* **Board A** could for example have the criteria, that users has to be at least 18 to access.
* **Board B** could for example have the criterias, that users has to be moderators and female, or administrator to access.

_Excerpt of criterias you could setup:_

* Min. age
* User level (from - to)
* Specific sex
* Less than 3 warnings
* Specific roles
* Member since
* _and much more..._

Abac is great for purposes like this.
The possibility to make assertions based on groups of permissions/attributes makes it very easy to customize and create permission groups suiting your needs.
