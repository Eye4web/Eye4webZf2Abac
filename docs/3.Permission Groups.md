# Permission groups

`Eye4web\Zf2Abac` supports multiple permission groups. This allows you to create different scenarios, that wil grant access.
An example could be, that you will grant access if the user is 18 or older (**group 1**), or the user has his parents approval (**group 2**).

Abac will pick the attributes, and divide them into groups and then check whether at least one of the groups' requirements are fulfilled.
