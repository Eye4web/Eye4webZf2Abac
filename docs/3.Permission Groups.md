# Permission groups

`Eye4web\Zf2Abac` supports multiple permission groups. This allows you to create different scenarios, that wil grant access.

Abac will pick the attributes, and divide them into groups and then check whether at least one of the groups' requirements are fulfilled.
Every rule in the groups works with **and** operators, and all the different groups work with or operators.

An example could be, that you will grant access if the user is 18 or older (**group 1**), **or** the user is 13 or older **and** has his parents approval (**group 2**).

If we rewrite this example into an if statement, it would be like this:
```php
if ($user->getAge() > 18 || ($user->getAge() > 13 && $user->hasParentApproval())) {
```
